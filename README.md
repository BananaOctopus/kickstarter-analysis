Performing analysis on Kickstarter data to uncover trends.

# Outcomes based on Launch Date Conclusions
* As you can see in the graph Theater Outcomes Based on Launch Date, the highest number of successful plays are launched in May, and then steadily decline until September. Since this data has been collected over several years, and overall plays launched in May have been successfully funded, the best time for Louise to launch her crowdfunding campaign will be May.  While there is always a percentage of risk and failure, there is a sharp increase in plays that fail when launched in October, so based on this graph, I would not recommend a launch in October. 
# Limitations of Outcomes based on Launch Date Data
* The limitations of this data is the data is the general launch date of the projects but does not include how long the projects were up on Kickstarter and the total goal of the projects.

# Outcomes based on Goals Conclusions
* The percentage of successful plays funded seems to decrease as the goal in funding increases, most likely because it becomes harder to reach a goal the larger the amount of money is. This trend continues until the goal becomes $30,000 or more and then falls off when the goal becomes $44,999 or more. 
# Limitations of Outcomes based on Goals Data
* The limitation of this data is that while there does seem to be a relationship between the funding goal and success/fail rate, the higher the amount the goal was the less total projects there were. So for example there was only one project for the goal range of $45,000 to $49,999 and it was successful, resulting in 100% of the projects in that range being successful. It would be misleading however, to base an assumption that a project would be successful in this goal range because it was only one play.
# Graphs/Data Worth Exploring
* A graph we could have included could be the success/fail rate of projects based on how long they stayed up on Kickstarter. My prediction for a data set would be the longer a project is posted, the more likely it would be successful, since giving people time to donate is important. This data would best be represented in a line graph, similar to the graph Outcomes Based on Goals. Another interesting collection of data would be the success and fail rate of plays based on if they would highlighted by the Kickstarter website or not.
